description={Quantum key distribution refers to the sharing of cryptographic keys using a quantum channel, to take advantage of coherence effects to guarantee security of the resulting key}

\newglossaryentry{qchannel} {
name={Quantum channel},
description={A transmission path that allows the sharing of quantum states}

\newglossaryentry{qber} {
name={Quantum bit error rate (QBER)},
description={The ratio of wrong bits against the total detected bits after the sifting phase, as measured by Bob}
}

\newglossaryentry{refPulse} {
name={Strong reference pulse},
description={A pulse transmitted as a phase reference, at a much higher photon number than the weak signal pulse, with the aim of preventing Eve from blocking the entire signal without introducing error}
}

\newglossaryentry{edp} {
name={Entanglement distillation protocol (EDP)},
description={A QKD protocol that makes use of non-local effects, rather than state orthogonality, to transmit a secret key}
}

\newglossaryentry{photonNumber} {
name={Photon number},
description={The average number of photons in a pulse - typical values are $\mu \ll 1$}
}

\newglossaryentry{nondemmeasurement} {
name={Quantum non-demolition measurement},
description={A special type of measurement where the uncertainty of the measured observable does not increase. Typically in the context of QKD refers to counting photon number without disturbing polarisation (or phase) hence preserving the encoding}

\newglossaryentry{shannonEntropy} {
name={Shannon entropy},
description={A measure of information contained in a message, as a function of characters (qubits or states) in a given stream. Given by the formula $H = -\sum_i p_i \mathrm{log}_b p_i$, where $p_i$ is the probability of character $i$ from character set of size $b$ showing up in the output stream}
}

\newglossaryentry{rawKey} {
name={Raw key},
description={The sequence of bits received by Bob, prior to the sifting phase. The raw key rate is the rate at which Bob is able to receive the bits sent by Alice, and is given by $R = \nu_s P_b$, where $\nu_s$ is the repetition rate, and $P_b$ is the probability that Bob accepts a bit.}
